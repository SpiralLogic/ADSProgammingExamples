# Permutations

Creates a permutation of a given set of letters.

The permutation will find each possible permutation of the set of letters and list them in order such that only one letter changes with each permutation
i.e<br>
abcd<br>
abdc<br>
acbd<br>
acdb <br>


etc.


A Factorial based number system is used to achieve this
