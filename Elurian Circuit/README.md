# Eularian Circuit

This program takes an input of strings and finds a eularian ciruit that connects them all
two strings are connected when the end of one string is the lame as the start of another

For example, these strings are connected:

this string-<br>
-his strings-<br>
--is strings -<br>

The output is the reconstruction of all of the strings from the input file
