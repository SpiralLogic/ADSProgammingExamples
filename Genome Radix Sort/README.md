# Genome and Radix Sort

This program operates in 2 parts<br>

1. generateKmers.py takes a text file of a genetic genome and produces a kmer file representing it<br>
2. radixLSD.py sorts the genome using a radix sort and outputs it into a file

This program can be used to find similar genetic sequences within a genetic string

# Complexities

Time complexity (n is number of genome segments, k is the length of those segments):<br>
O(n * k)<br>
